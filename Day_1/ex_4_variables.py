# There are two variables, a and b from input
a = input()
b = input()
# 🚨 Don't change the code above ☝️
####################################
# Write your code below this line 👇
a, b = b, a #This is an advanced concept jajaja, did a little cheating here, I already knew this concept, but I shouldnt have used it on this level of python.
# Alternative solution:
# c = a
# a = b
# b = c


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)
